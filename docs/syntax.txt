CodeOPS Syntax Guide

Overview
CodeOPS is an operations-oriented programming language.
Everything revolves around operations and execution flow.

File extension
.ops

Variables
Variables are defined using the set keyword.

Syntax:
set name = "value"

Example:
set app = "CodeOPS"
set env = "prod"

Variables can be used inside commands with this syntax:
${variable_name}

Commands
Commands execute shell instructions.

Syntax:
run "command"

Example:
run "echo Hello World"

Operations
Operations group multiple commands.

Syntax:
op operationName {
run "command"
run "another command"
}

Operations are not executed automatically.

Calling operations
Operations are executed by calling them like functions.

Syntax:
operationName()

Example:
start()

Execution order

1. Variables are registered
2. Operations are registered
3. Instructions are executed in order
4. Operation calls run their internal commands

Errors
If CodeOPS finds an unknown token or operation, execution stops
and an error message is shown with line information when possible.

Philosophy
Less ceremony.
More action.
Everything is an operation.
